Purpose of this project was to introduce us to c# by letting us do our first Project was to recreate our final 1st year project 
in 1 week. Both my friend and I implemented a 3 layer design(VIEW, Container, Domain). This project demostrated our knowledge
about Inheritance, Polymorphism, Overloading/Overiding functions and show our understanding about good OOP design.

This project will allow you to add any 3 vehicle, allow you the display all, sort by model, and by type. It will also allow you
delete.
